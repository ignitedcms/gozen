# Gozen

Gozen full stack framework for Go with a ridiculously low dependency chain.

## About
Go developers are traditionally very picky when it comes to what and what 
they don't want. We've built Gozen with this in mind. It only uses go-chi,
a super lightweight Go router and a few Gorilla pacakges. 
Zero ORMs or any other third party libraries. Ensuring Gozen
is lightweight and giving you confidence that things won't break in the future.
